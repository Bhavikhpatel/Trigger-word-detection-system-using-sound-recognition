# Trigger Word Detection System  

A Flask-based web application that detects a **trigger word (wake word)** in an uploaded or recorded audio file. The system preprocesses the input, generates a spectrogram, passes it through a trained deep learning model, and overlays a chime sound whenever the trigger word is detected.

## Overview  

This project implements a **real-time trigger word detection system** using deep learning.  
It performs:
1. Audio preprocessing (resampling, trimming/padding, normalization)
2. Spectrogram generation
3. Prediction using a pre-trained model
4. Chime overlay when the wake word is detected
5. Visualization of trigger word detection probability

- Flask web interface for easy audio upload and prediction  
- Automatic conversion of browser-recorded audio (`.webm`) to `.wav`  
- Audio preprocessing to ensure model compatibility  
- Deep learningâ€“based wake word detection  
- Visualization of prediction probability graph  
- Chime overlay output when the wake word is detected  
- Audio download and playback functionality
